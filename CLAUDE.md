# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python project for rapid prototyping with Streamlit and Machine Learning, containing course materials in Portuguese ("Material do curso de prototipagem rápida com Streamlit e Machine Learning").

## Project Structure

- Currently a minimal repository with only configuration files
- The repository is set up as a Python project (based on .gitignore)
- No source code files are present yet
- Contains standard Python development environment files (.gitignore covers Python, virtual environments, testing, etc.)

## Development Setup

Since this appears to be a new Python project for Streamlit/ML development, typical setup would involve:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies (likely to include streamlit, common ML libraries)

## Project Status

This is an initial/empty repository setup for a Streamlit and Machine Learning course. No build commands, tests, or source code are present yet. Future development will likely involve:
- Adding Streamlit applications
- Implementing ML models and prototypes
- Setting up requirements for dependencies
